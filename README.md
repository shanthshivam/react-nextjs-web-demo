## To Make Modifications to the Code base

1. Create a folder under app/ directory. You will need viewall and insurancequote then create directories in that name.
2. You will page.tsx for sure. If you want to change the layout of this component then you will need layout.tsx.
3. All you API calls will be part of the page.tsx
